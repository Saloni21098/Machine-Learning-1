# MNIST Digit Binary Classification with Logistic Regression
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that uses logistic regression to classify digits in the MNIST dataset, specifically predicting whether an image represents the number 8.

## Project Goals:
- Learn the fundamentals of building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Experiment with logistic regression for image classification.

## Current Performance:
The current model achieves an F1 score of approximately 70%. This score can be improved upon with further experimentation.

## Factors to consider:
- MNIST, while a common dataset, can still present challenges for certain models, especially for binary classification compared to multi-class classification.
- While a powerful tool, Logistic Regression might not be the most optimal choice for complex datasets like MNIST. 
- Experiment with different algorithms.
- Experiment with different learning rates, regularization parameters, etc., to find the best configuration for the model.
